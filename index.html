	<p>Looks like a regular 2 Series to me. 
That’s part of the appeal. What you’re looking at is an M240i xDrive. 335bhp and 369lb ft from a turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six like the regular M240i, only with rear-biased all-wheel drive instead of rear-wheel drive, and the quick-shifting eight-speed automatic gearbox. There is no manual option. 0-62mph takes 4.4 seconds, which is a tenth quicker than a manual M2 and a tenth slower than the DCT, even though it’s heavier by 45 and 20kg respectively (50kg heavier than a regular, auto M240i). It is also much cheaper, just as torquey and miles more subtle – if you’re into that.  
AWD means grip, no? 
Indeed. We drove it around Munich – not known for its roads, admittedly – one exceptionally rainy, July afternoon, and were astonished by the amount of traction it summoned up. Stomp on the gas from a dead standstill and, even with the traction control at its most off, the M240 just squats on its axles and hurls itself at the horizon. Much more quickly than an M2 could in the same circumstances. Even in the dry you’ll be going at least as quickly as the big M. And that’s very quickly indeed. First and second gears are Vehicles have been getting bigger and bigger, leaving fewer choices for the select buyer who is seeking something more compact. Thankfully, the 2020 BMW 2 Series satisfies the desire for a smaller alternative.

Up until this model year, the 2 Series has only been offered in coupe form, which kept it from competing directly against the Mercedes-Benz A-Class and the Audi A3. For 2020, the 2 Series expands with the introduction of the Gran Coupe, a four-door version that is covered in a separate review. Our initial reactions to the larger 2 Series are very favorable, complicating your shopping decision in a most delightful way. Most significantly, it offers a great deal more rear-seat space than the coupe.

But if you don't need the extra passenger space, the 2 Series coupe will definitely satisfy. It has a fantastic blend of performance, comfort and refinement, especially for the price. Thanks to the large trunk capacity, it's also rather practical. Don't let the price fool you, the 2020 BMW 2 Series is a legitimate luxury sport coupe that deserves the badge and your attention.

Which 2 Series does Edmunds recommend?
The vast majority of drivers will find the base 230i to their liking since it has more than enough power and overall performance. Despite its entry-level position, you won't feel as though you're getting anything less than a legitimate BMW.
BMW 2 Series models
The 2020 BMW 2 Series is available as either a coupe or convertible in 230i and M240i trims that are mainly distinguished by engines. The 230i coupe is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (248 horsepower, 258 lb-ft of torque). The M240i gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder (335 hp, 369 lb-ft).BMW 2 Series vs. Mercedes-Benz A-Class
The Mercedes-Benz A-Class is our top-ranked entry-level luxury sedan. But since the 2 Series has only been offered as a coupe, BMW has been out of the running. Until now. A new 2 Series Gran Coupe is on the way, and our initial reactions are very favorable. It's sportier than the Mercedes, yet there's no appreciable sacrifice as a result.

BMW 2 Series vs. Audi A3
The Audi A3 delivers performance that approaches the 2 Series and gets similar accolades for interior quality and comfort. It's also a few thousand dollars less than the BMW, but its back seats are also just as limiting for passengers. Points are further deducted for the tiny trunk capacity that is even smaller with all-wheel drive.

BMW 2 Series vs. Audi A5
Pricing for the Audi A5 starts at the top of the range for the 2 Series, but it's also in a slightly elevated class of vehicles. The interior is a bit nicer, and the larger footprint means it has more rear passenger space. We pile on more points for its strong performance and generous features list. Our criticisms are minor and include a lack of interior storage.

Compare BMW 2 Series & Audi A5 featureseople who buy cars first and foremost because they’re fun tend to have a distinct thought process. Where the average shopper will wonder if the optional panoramic sunroof is worth the money, the enthusiast has already mentally nixed it, because the roof just adds needless weight. That enthusiast just wants the most performance that he or she can afford—and is usually willing to make sacrifices in other areas to get it.

Those decisions get tricky when you’re looking at a stepladder of fun-first models and deciding which rung you should stop at. Take the Ford Mustang GT vs. the Shelby GT350. Or the Subaru WRX and WRX STI. Or, today’s subject, the BMW M240i, versus the M2. Yes, the M2 is not only the epitome of the 2 Series lineup, but perhaps the most stereotypically “BMW” model in today’s BMW showroom. That is, a relatively small, traditional-bodied car—as opposed to a hopped-up Sports Activity Coupe—that offers a manual transmission and doesn’t cost six figures like an i8 or a new M5. The M2’s wallet-sizzling dealer mark-ups have cooled since its debut, but this l’il Bimmer still starts at $55,495 in 2018.And the price is about to jump along with the performance. The 2019 M2 Competition, which starts production this month and replaces the previous M2, brings a 405-horsepower version of the larger M4’s twin-turbo inline six, along with a host of upgrades. Sounds awesome, but the M2 Competition’s $59,895 price represents a $4,400 jump over the 2018 M2. It will cost $1,600 more than a Ford Mustang Shelby GT350, and $3,300 more than a Corvette Stingray. Of course, only the world’s most open-minded individual is cross-shopping a BMW coupe with V8 ‘Stangs and 'Vettes, so that’s the last I’ll mention it. Point is, the M2 and M2 Competition, though fairly priced in BMW terms, are still quite expensive for a two-door compact. 

So if you’re already correcting me and saying “too expensive,” then consider the M240i. Starting from $46,445, the M240i will rock a road nearly as well as its big-bore M2 stablemate, but without wiping out a bank account.

Really, every ingredient you need is baked into this fun-sized M240i, beginning with a direct-injection, 3.0-liter inline six with a twin-scroll turbocharger and variable valve timing and camshaft lift. Its 365 horsepower is 30 fewer than the 2018 M2, but the M240i counters with 26 additional pound-feet of torque, at 369 pound-feet. That lofty torque peak is fully on tap anywhere between 1,520 and 4,500 rpm. Choose the six-speed manual transmission (a no-cost option), and the M240i scampers from 0-60 mph in BMW’s conservatively-estimated 4.6 seconds. 

That drops to 4.4 seconds with the eight-speed paddle-shiftable automatic, and to a scorching 4.2 seconds if you spend $2,000 for xDrive AWD. You can’t get AWD on the M2, and members of the rear-drive cult might blanch at the thought. But an owner in Maine or Michigan could well see the upside—as opposed to his BMW’s downside, after it winds up flipped in a ditch—of a 2 Series with four-season capability. With BMW pegging the M2’s acceleration at 4.3 seconds with its optional (and quicker) dual-clutch automatic, that M240i xDrive is officially 0.1 seconds faster to 60 mph. Compare apples-to-apples, rear-drive automatic models, and the M240i trails the vaunted M2, but only by the same tenth of a second. Bottom line, this M240i is seriously fast—and its performance specs don’t begin to describe how enjoyable it is to drive on real roads.
